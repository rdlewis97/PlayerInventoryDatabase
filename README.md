# PlayerInventoryDatabase

This inventory system was created within Visual Studio, using C# and MySQL.


This system can store many different players inventories, which can contain any quantity of items from the All Items list. Items can be added or removed from the players inventory, or quantity of an item edited.

For example, to add a new item to a player's inventory, the user should first select a player inventory from the 'Inventory' list box. They should then select an item from the 'All Items' list box and then input a quantity into the 'Quantity' textbox field, before clicking 'Add Item'.
